# Yelp-Camp-old
[link](https://lagamorpha.github.io/Yelp-Camp/)

This is the main project for a web development class I've been working on.
It's basically a Yelp for sharing and rating campgrounds (though mine retained some farm assets from a previous project).

it is outdated and in the process of being phased out due to breaks

## Technologies
I used mostly bootstrap and mongo with a little node/express to get this running.
